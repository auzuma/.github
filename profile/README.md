# Hello, tech world! üëãüèø

We are **Auzuma Technologies**, a new tech startup. Our mission is to **use technology to positively and effectively make our world a better place**. AI is our initial focus right now, so most of our early innovations will come from our **AI division, A0**. We're already developing an AI safety, ethics, trust, and accuracy checker called **SafetyLens**. We're gearing up to launch SafetyLens 1.0 as an open-source project around mid-April ‚Äî please [get ready to explore and contribute by following us on GitHub](https://github.com/auzuma)!

This includes building tools that support multilingual interfaces, adaptive designs, assistive technologies, and open-source creations (here on GitHub), creating a global impact through inclusion.
